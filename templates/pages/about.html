        <h2>Built to Solve Real Problems</h2>
      </div>
      <div data-animate style="text-align: center;">
        <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: var(--color-slate-600); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          InvoiceFlow was born out of frustration with overly complicated invoicing software. We saw freelancers, small business owners, and agencies struggling with tools that were either too basic or unnecessarily complex.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: var(--color-slate-600); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          We set out to create something different—a platform that combines professional-grade features with an interface anyone can use. No steep learning curves, no hidden fees, just straightforward invoicing that works.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: var(--color-slate-600); line-height: 1.8;">
          Today, InvoiceFlow helps thousands of businesses streamline their billing, automate their reminders, and get paid faster than ever before.
